<PoemContent>

> The Face Dirtier is out there day after day,
> He watches and waits until I go to play.
>
> I told my mum I would keep my face clean,
> But he was waiting out there, hidden and unseen.
>
> He was ready for mischief as I ran outside,
> I couldn't avoid him, 'though I really did try!
>
> In the puddle, I jumped,
> There was mud that he dumped.
>
> In the tree I climbed,
> There was a bug trail; he slimed.
>
> In the bushes, I scrambled
> He left dirt on the brambles.
>
> When I got home, my mum she could see,
> The ginormous mess he had made of me.
>
> She laughed so much as she sent me to bath,
> And giggled so hard as she cleaned my dirt path.
>
> I don't understand why grown-ups can't see,
> It's the Face Dirtier who does it. It's really not me!
