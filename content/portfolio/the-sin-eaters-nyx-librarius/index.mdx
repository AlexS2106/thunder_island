## Introduction 

Eight years, seven months and 12 days ago, there were 67 million humans on the Island of Great Britain, part of the continent of Europe. They flourished as creatures of sunlight and, during their short time of existence, had come to dominate their world. 

Eight years, seven months and 12 days ago, 3466 daemanoth Hives with 5821 Queens shared the land of Ha' Dreyna, a world in Darkness. The daemanoth were an ancient species born when time began, and they, too, dominated their world. 

Eight years, seven months and 11 days ago, the human and daemanoth dimensions collided. That First Merging was a violent upheaval of the planet as two separate dimensions sought to co-exist within one. Matter fought against matter, and existence fought against existence until, slowly, a balance was forged. The tremors ceased, the winds slowed, and the fires died; light and dark alternated the skies, and two species who believed themselves alone discovered otherwise. Their once thriving populations were decimated, and those who remained emerged in their new shared world to learn that they, too, needed to find balance.

Less than a year later, another previously unknown, unaware realm crashed into the others. The newly merged dimension was fractured. Its magic leaked across the land, bringing Gifts of incredible power and bestowing them upon beings who were never meant to wield them. And, as the dust settled, the Keres began to coalesce.

## Chapter 1

In the midst of the Darkness, I looked up into the crimson gaze of the demonic beasts who had knocked on my door and stepped aside to let the largest one in...

'A short Darkness, only 31 hours.' Said the young daemanoth who had been given the venerable task of informing the delicate humans in Chirrax territory so we could fortify our homes and quiver in fear. After the fortifying, I had decided to relax with a not-so-bad alcoholic beverage, the maker of which had called beer, and a book. I had doubts about the beer, but the book was great. Unlike most humans, I happen to like Darknesses, and, given the thickness of my book, 31 hours was perfect. I had dressed for comfort. I was wearing my thickest dressing robe, which had begun life as pale blue but was now a stylish grey, over flannel pyjamas and fluffy socks. I had not been expecting guests, so when a cohort of angry daemanoth called five hours later, I was, quite obviously, unprepared. Now their supreme leader, one of them anyway, was inside my home, and his red glowing eyes told me bad news was heading my way. 

The impressive specimen of male daemanoth before me hailed by the name of Bale, warrior caste by birth, and Alpha to Daeres, Hive Queen of the Chirrax. That makes him a VIP in daemanoth terms, only a queen can trump him, and he has too many balls for that job. Bale was the result of the fine-tuning of genetics to provide the nearest-to-perfect warrior millennia of daemanoth evolution could achieve. Power, speed and brains with a great pair of wings. It all makes me want to hate him, but, unfortunately, he's likeable as well, damn it! The impressive specimen looked down, I looked up, and we stood chest to face in my living room beneath the overhanging gallery and its ongoing renovation. While he still had plenty of headroom, his flame-cast shadow loomed like a gigantic flickering beast curving onto the ceiling for some added menace. 

'Nyx Librarius, Daeres summons you.' He snarled.

Nyx Librarius is me, not the name I received at birth, but with so many things lost in the First Merging, a name is as easy to don and shed as lizard skin, and mine needed shedding. Now, I am Nyx Librarius, a name that suits me well. I am also known to some as the Gifted of Shadows, an indigo power from the Second Merging I wield as I will. 

Since even the happiest of daemanoth tend to snarl, hiss or growl when talking I didn't take Bale's snarled summoning personally. A daemanoth's eyes are a far more accurate indicator of mood, and Bale's were glowing red, the bloody colour whirling slowly. Any shade of red was assign of anger, while the swirling within indicated the intensity of the emotion. Currently, Bale was in a slow-burning rage. I deemed it best for my well-being to tiptoe carefully.

I didn't bother asking why I was required. Even if he knew why, and there was no guarantee he did, if the Hive Queen wanted to see me, that was enough for him, and he expected it to be enough for me. I lived within Daeres' territory, Hive Queen of Chirrax, and although this came with many human benefits, food, clothing, a home, light and protection, there were a few inconveniences - cue the large daemanoth expecting me to drop everything. When the Hive Queen says jump, the only question to ask is how high. Humans within her territory are lucky; others, far less so. 

'I need to prepare.' I said, pointing downwards at my ensemble and awaiting some kind of affirmation before moving. He glanced down and back up and nodded without asking me where he could get his very own fluffy socks. Retrieving another bottle of my not-so-bad beer, I handed it over. He took it, speared the cork with a talon, casually flipped it open, and drank. Right beside the kitchen sink was the rusty corkscrew I had used to open mine; obviously, he didn't feel he needed it.

Upstairs and away from illumminated eyes, I chose my workwear: a thermal top and leggings layered with trousers, a long-sleeved top, a jumper and a coat. One never truly appreciates the warmth a daily sunrise provides until one is forced to do without it. All my clothing was black, black on black on black. I like black, it works everywhere and for every occasion. It was neat but not noticeable; it hid me, it hid dirt, and it hid blood. I filled my backpack with clothes, food, water, firesticks and a thick cloak and strapped on my knives and bow sling.

By the time I returned, the fire had begun to penetrate Bale's warrior leathers, so he no longer emanated cold, and my hospitality, along with a bit of time, had diminished his eye glow from red to an orange which cast an amber light around the room. I knelt by the fire I had enjoyed for a mere five hours and poured water over the flames.

Outside, a cohort of daemanoth warriors stood looking outwards into the gloom while another tended to a chiroptera, a giant bat-like creature of Ha' Dreyna, long domesticated by the daemanoth to transport their wingless brethren when required. How lovely, I was about to travel in style!

'Salvan,' I said, acknowledging the warrior holding the chiroptera's reins. He was Bale's blood-bonded and despite being less statuesque was almost as lethal. 'You came prepared.' 

'Just for you, Nyx, just for you. How're things?' Salvan said, giving me a leg up. He passed over the reins and left me in the moonlight as he looked down to adjust the stirrups and leg straps that would prevent a sharp drop and sudden stop should the chiroptera turn suddenly.

'I had a new book to read.' I said, nodding to him as he shortened and tightened the straps on my left side.

'Mystery?' He asked, glancing up with a slight smile tugging at his lips. 'Test it.' 

'Of course, a mystery!' I replied and pushed down on the stirrup, testing the leg straps. 'Feels good.' I informed him, and he moved around the back of the chiroptera to repeat the process on my right side. 

'Got a new bag, I see.' He said, nodding to my new backpack before shortening the stirrups for my right foot. My last summoning by Daeres had sent me into a cave after an annis, a pale withered looking predator from Ha' Dreyna, with oversized teeth and claws. It had died, and I had lived, but my bag had become a workplace casualty.

'Had to. The teeth marks let water in.'

'Well, annis'… they have a good strong bite all right.' He grinned. With one last tug, he patted my right leg. 'Okay, test.' 

I stood up as much as possible, pushing hard on the stirrups moving forward, back and side to side before sitting back down. 'Feels good.'

'Great. Can't be losing my favourite human.' He winked at me before stepping back. His smile faded, but his eye glow still graduated towards green.

'Fly.' Bale barked, taking one step before launching himself into the air with the rest of us behind him. I grasped tightly to the reins and leaned forward to counterbalance as the chiroptera gained height. As we levelled out, the daemanoth arranged themselves: Bale at the front, Salvan took point, and the remaining warriors settled themselves above, below and to either side. I wondered who they were protecting: myself or my ride. I would like to believe it was me, but with most modern forms of transport destroyed and remaining supplies of petrol close to ending, humans were becoming increasingly desperate for other options. The chiropteri, while more comfortable in the dark, had proved resilient to light, and the result was an all-out clamouring for the beasts, who had suffered as much devastation to their own population as humans and daemanoth. Combine the chiropteri's slow reproduction rate with humanity's usual lack of patience, and plenty of unsavoury methods for gaining a beast for one's own had emerged. The Chirrax, along with many of the other Hives, now guarded their chiropteri as well as they guarded their humans.

By the light of the three moons, I watched the cresting and dipping of the blanket of green beneath me. It was a reworking of natures: magnificent oak trees and valleys of clear burbling water from my own Yorkshire, a prehistoric covering of enormous leaf-drenched brush clattering in the wind from Ha' Dreyna, ghostly moss and heather glistening like an ever-present sprinkling of luminescent frost from the Keres realm. The two mergings had combined three realms into a spectacular wild landscape.

Beneath us, an eerie howl, a shuck had found prey, and the returning barks coordinated the pack. The stag ran for his life. I knew how he felt. Our animals have found their own way of living – and dying.

Here and there, a human village appeared. A small collection of cottages slowly but surely growing in size. Broken and devastated, we were still here. Hive Queen Daeres believed in inter-species cooperation, and the eyes of daemanoth warriors on watch speared the skies as we passed, and a talon or two waved as we passed. Isolated cottages that had survived the Mergings lay broken and forgotten; only the bravest few would live alone. I loved my new world. Do you get the idea I'm not a people person?

Ahead, I saw Chirrax Hive. During sunlight, it reminded me of an enormous version of a deserted termite mound casting a long shadow over the landscape, but this was a Darkness, and the Hive fluttered with a frenzy of activity that boarded on chaos. It was like watching an eagle's eye view of London traffic without realising there were rules. At the top, winged daemanoth seemed to narrowly miss crashing as they launched themselves into the air or back winged for a precision landing. Those on the ground scurried around each other in and out of the maw. Harvesters carried food, keepers logged goods, and warriors guarded. Inside, there would be more: carers, hosts, the young and the old, the all-important queens, and the Hive Queen.

We flew in low, passing over the top of Chirton Village, clustering around the base of the Hive. Unlike all other human villages, this one was not locked and barred against the Darkness and its terrors but was alive with activity, and just beyond, at the top of a gentle slope, was the black maw of the Hive teeming with daemanoth. We stopped on the lip, and I began liberating myself from the straps around my thighs while Salvan helped by undoing those around my feet. Finally free, I slipped off the chiroptera and went around the front of the beast to give him a thank-you-for-the-ride chin scritch while he gave me a you're-welcome drool mark.

We walked into the mouth of the Hive, and while warriors marked my presence, being with their big boss gave me unshakeable kudos, so they let me be. Edi, a host who seemed generally stationed to serve around the maw's edges, did not, and he scurried forward with two others of his caste, looking eager to help. Serving is a part of a host's nature, their inbuilt genetic place within the Hive, and doing for myself disrupts the harmony of their world. Unwilling to be surrounded by red eyes swirling at the speed of an f5 tornado because I unbuttoned my own coat, I allowed them to undress me while I tried not to get in their way. All hosts sport an extra pair of arms, making them seem more alien than the other daemanoth castes to me - even the ones with wings. However, I had no doubts the extra appendages proved worthwhile as their short, blunt talons quickly unbuttoned Bale and Salvan's leathers. In no time, the two warriors stood in only the cool, white cotton shorts warriors liked to wear beneath their leathers while a happy Edi stripped me down to my thermal leggings and top. The green of Edi's eyes momentarily flirted with blue as he spotted the chiroptera's drool mark - no doubt my coat would be thoroughly clean by my return. 
 
Bale led, Salvan took his customary point position, and I tried to look taller as we entered the hive. For those many humans who have never been inside one, hives are a riot of colour. The Second Merging might have given a few rare humans their Gifts, but it had bestowed every previously black-eyed daemanoth with individuality, reflected in eyes which glowed. Thousands of beings with different moods add a rainbow of colours to even the deepest corners of a hive. Flourishing within the tunnels and chambers was the Keres' glow moss, a living light source throwing out spectral illumination. The blackness of the maw seen from the outside is a colourless illusion for the ignorant.

I followed the black velvet expanse of muscled back before me, fully aware we were on our way to see his Hive Queen, who could decapitate me with a talon swipe, and admired the hive interior as I always did. Geometric patterns are non-existent within a hive, and corners and straight lines are rare. There is a lack of visual patterns and visible organisation that appeals to the anarchist in me. Construction occurs on an at-need basis, and nobody sues because there was a dip they happened to fall over. The result is bewildering sets of tunnels and stairs, which are not always the most accessible routes to negotiate, going in every direction or sometimes none at all. It is chaotic and wild and as different from modern human architecture as possible. I find it makes for a unique, beautiful interior. The daemanoth find it makes them secure. The maze-like hives place any attempted invasion at a disadvantage, for invaders must negotiate these bewildering routes while in combat with a hive that knows its home well.  

Our haphazard route was ever-descending, the heat thickened the further we went, and humidity clogged the air. It wasn't long before sweat began to saturate my clothes. We were nearing the centre of the hive.
