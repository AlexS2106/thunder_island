## Introduction To Fantasy

My first encounter with the Welsh fantasy world of Prydain was long ago. In fact, I credit this series with my first step into reading fantasy and hold it solely responsible for the path of a lifelong love of the genre. I loved these books, and I still do. The originals I was gifted as a child are still with me more than thirty years later. They sit, battered and bruised through countless readings, on my shelf beside The Wheel Of Time, the little brother of fantasy holding his own against the big brother.  

## Children's Book Classification

The Chronicles of Prydain are technically children's books, but then so is Harry Potter, and, let's admit it, that didn't stop any of us from a good read! So, let's put this aside and lose ourselves in one of the best fantasy worlds I have ever been emersed in.

## Coming-of-age Story

The Prydain Chronicles is a coming-of-age story following the life of a young boy called Taran. 

We meet him first as he is anointed with the embarrassing position of assistant pig-keeper despite his dreams of being a great hero. 

When Taran subsequently loses the pig, his efforts to retrieve her begin his first adventure told in The Book of Three. The Book of Three introduces many of the main characters who recur throughout each subsequent book. 

Taran is our hero-to-be. Dallben, Prydain's greatest enchanter. Coll, the Pig-Keeper and a secret hero. Gwydion, the famous hero, but nothing like Taran had imagined a hero should be. Eilonwy, the very talkative princess. Fflewddur Fflam, the not-so-talented bard, and the always-hungry creature called Gurgi. Other equally unique characters also come and go. 

Over the following four books, Taran grows up and becomes a hero himself and realises heroism is not all he thought it would be. The sacrifices are many, and the advantages few. 

## Welsh Mythology

While much of the story, subplots and characters are adapted from Welsh mythology, Lloyd Alexander unleashed his imagination to write these books. 

I put the world-building of Prydain on a par with Tolkien's Middle-earth or Jordan's The Wheel Of Time. 

All too often, I find the main characters of a book lacking while wishing the supporting actors had the starring roles. This is not the case with Alexander's characters; they are interesting, likeable, and well above the usual literary standard. I was invested in their stories and survival throughout all the books. 

## Worth Reading

The Prydain Chronicles is a lovely series which tells five entertaining stories. The main focus is on Taran, the assistant pig-keeper, and his journey from naive boyhood to worthy manhood. It is worth a read whether you are 8 or 80.
