## Urban Fantasy

I bought one book after another of this series and, at the end of the series of ten, I was disappointed because I couldn't buy more.

These books are what they are supposed to be. It's a young adult urban fantasy series that entertains. If you want an epic fantasy series with incredible world-building, better try The Wheel of Time. If you want a moral ending that might possibly right the wrongs of the world, try The Lord of the Rings. However, if you want a book series for pure entertainment value, this will fit the bill – perfectly!

## The Perfect Heroine

Good-looking heroine but not too good-looking? Check! A heroine we like? Check. Kickass? Check! Witty? Check! Strong-willed? Check! A few appealing flaws? Check! Now for the hero. Let's see… Good looking? Check! Manly? Check! A good match for our heroine? Check! Adores the heroine we are now convinced is perfect in every way? Check! After some trials and tribulations, a meeting that sees them getting together for a long-anticipated smooch? A few more trials and tribulations from outside sources set on their destruction? They come through it to be better and stronger than ever before? Nope, not telling you! Read the series and find out for yourself!

## The World Of Kate Daniels

The Kate Daniels series is set in Atlanta, America. While I previously implied that you should look elsewhere to find incredible world-building, this is not strictly true. There isn't a complex map or new lands; however, the authors have dreamt up an alternative reality to the world we know in a very unique way. A difficult task these days. In many fantasy books, magic is leaving the modern world. In Kate Daniels' World, it is coming back and causing mayhem as it fights for dominancy against the non-magic world.

## About The Kate Daniels Books

Each book in the series contains a story unto itself that places Kate into different situations she has to resolve, from an unkillable being to a plague-wielding goddess. However, each book also advances Kate's relationships with those around her, pushes her life and lifestyle forward, and moves the underlying plot of the showdown between Kate and her ultimate arch-nemesis towards its inevitable conclusion. So, while you could read them out of order, I would say, "Don't do it!". Reading this series of books in order will be money and time enjoyably spent.

## The Series In Order

The Kate Daniels Series consists of these ten books. Here they are, in order, to make life easier.

- Magic Bites
- Magic Burns
- Magic Strikes
- Magic Bleeds
- Magic Slays
- Magic Rises
- Magic Breaks
- Magic Shifts
- Magic Binds
- Magic Triumphs

## Spin-offs

There are also a few spin-offs, which are worth the money and the spawning of two new series starring some of the secondary characters, which have also begun with promise.

Enjoy!
