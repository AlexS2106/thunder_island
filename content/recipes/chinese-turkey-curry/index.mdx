Credit for Chinese Turkey Curry does not belong to me. The original of this simple yet tasty little recipe is on a website called [Bbcgoodfood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com) as [Chinese Chicken Curry](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/chinese-chicken-curry).

Shock, horror! Why is it not mine? Well, ~I~ ~f~e~l~t~ ~l~a~z~y~. There are days when creativity fails, yet I still want something new. On those days, I hit two recipe sites - [Bbcgoodfood.co.uk](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com) and [allrecipes](http://allrecipes.com). These two are my favourites because they are the only two recipe websites where I can find the recipe on the page! On many websites, the recipe is floating somewhere within a sea of blurb buried beneath a mountain of advertising. Often, it is too much hassle to look. This is not so much a criticism of others in their forging of a money-making enterprise but a reflection of the length of my patience.

This recipe, oh so nicely presented and easy to read, thankyou Bbcgoodfood, was done and ready within 30 minutes. I loved it. My husband _really_ loved it - he went back for seconds, thirds and fourths. My kids liked it, unfortunately not quite as much as fish fingers and chips, predictably, but what can you do?

I did adapt it a little for a couple of reasons. One was laziness; the original recipe recommends blending the sauce, and I didn't feel like blending, so I didn't. The second was the use of chicken instead of turkey. Recently my ability to cook juicy, delicious chicken has disappeared. Mystified by this sudden failure in my culinary skills, I tried various cooking methods only to get the same result and gave up buying chicken. My husband wanted to eat chicken, so he bought some and tried... he also failed. With two of us failing, I decided it wasn't just me. Time to consult online - what did I ever do before the internet?

Apparently, I am far from alone! The answer, it seems, is the need to produce large quantities of chicken for little cost. This has led to the mass inbreeding of chickens and something described as 'woodiness' in the meat. Unfortunately, the only cure for this was to head off to the organic food section. With today's economics, personal health has to be balanced against affordability, and organic produce is pricey. I looked at buying turkey instead; after all, there are bird-like similarities! Turkey meat has become our substitute. Be prepared to see many turkey recipes coming this way!
