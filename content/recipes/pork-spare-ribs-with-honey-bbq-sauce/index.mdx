### Instructions

#### Preparation

    - Rub the salt onto all sides of the pork spare ribs and cut the ribs every 2-3 ribs.
    - Mix all the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and place the ribs in the bowl.

  - **Step 2**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 190°C.
  - **Step 3**
    - Line the bottom of a baking tray with 2-3 layers of thick aluminium foil.
    - Place the ribs, meat-side down, flat on the baking tray.
    - Pour any leftover marinade over the ribs.
    - Use another sheet of aluminium foil to cover the ribs in the tray.
  - **Step 4**
    - Cook the ribs in the oven for 1 hour, turning the ribs every 15 mins.
    - Remove the covering layer of aluminium foil at 30 mins.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve.
