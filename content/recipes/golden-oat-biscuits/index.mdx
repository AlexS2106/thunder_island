<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 100 g oats
- 100 g self-raising flour
- 100 g buttery/veg spread
- 100 g sugar
- 1 tbsp golden syrup
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Preheat an oven (_not_ fan-assisted) to 180°C.
- **Step 2**
  - Place all the ingredients into a food processor and mix. Psuh the ingredients away from the sides of the processor in between pulses because things get a bit stuck to the sides.
- **Step 3**
  - Take about 1 tbsp of the mixture and roll it into a ball in your hands, press both hands together to flatten the ball into a biscuit shape.
  - Place the biscuit onto a baking tray, allowing plenty of space between each biscuit.
  - Repeat until you have approximately 16 biscuits.
- **Step 4**
  - Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 mins, flipping them over halfway through - they will still be very soft and there will be doubts. Fear not! They will turn out fab!
- **Step 5**
  - Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 mins before eating.
