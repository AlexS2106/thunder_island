<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 6 x eggs
  - 300 g sugar
  - ½ tsp vanilla extract
  - 1 x tin sliced peaches
  - 1 x tub Elmlea whipping cream (or any whipping cream)

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Drain the peaches, and use the juice for something else.
  - Separate the whites of the eggs, and use the yolks for something else.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Pre-heat a fan-assisted oven to 180°C.
  - **Step 2**
    - Whisk the egg whites into stiff peaks.
    - When the peaks are stiff, slowly add the sugar. Keep whisking all the time.
    - Add the vanilla extract.
    - Continue to whisk until the mixture looks shiny.
  - **Step 3**
    - Prepare a baking sheet on a baking tray.
    - Spoon the mix onto the baking sheet in a long rectangular shape.
  - **Step 4**
    - Bake in the centre of the oven for 15 minutes. Keep a close eye on the meringue for the last 5 minutes of cooking to prevent burning.
    - When the meringue is ready, remove it from the oven and leave it to cool.
  - **Step 5**
    - When the meringue is cool, lift the baking sheet with the meringue on top onto a flat surface and turn it upside down. 
    - With the meringue now on the bottom, carefully peel the baking sheet off the meringue. Keep the baking sheet aside.
  - **Step 6**
    - Whisk the cream.
   - Spoon the cream over the meringue - don't go all the way to the edges.
    - Scatter the peaches over the cream.
  - **Step 7**
    - Roll the meringue over until it resembles a *log*. Use the previously discarded baking sheet to help: push the top of the meringue over and roll.
  - **Step 8**
    - Serve chilled.
