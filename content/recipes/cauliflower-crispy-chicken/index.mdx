<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

- In a food processor, blitz the cauliflower into rice.
- Beat the ½ egg.

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Mix the sweet paprika, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, allspice, nutmeg, ginger, and mustard on a plate.
  - Place the beaten egg on another plate.
  - Place the cauliflower rice on a third plate.
- **Step 2**
  - Beat the chicken breasts to flatten them until they are no more than 2cm (3/4 inch) in thickness.
  - Dip each breast into the herb mix, coat one side, then the other.
  - Then, dip the breasts into the egg, coat one side, then the other.
  - Then, dip the chicken into the cauliflower mix, coat one side, then the other.
  - Use your fingers to put some more cauliflower on any sparse areas.
- **Step 3**
  - Melt the lard on medium-high heat (Number 7).
  - When the lard is hot, fry the chicken for 5 minutes on each side.
  - Try not to move the chicken around the pan too much as the coating can be a bit delicate while cooking.
  - Remove the chicken from the heat when cooked through.
- **Step 4**
  - Serve.
