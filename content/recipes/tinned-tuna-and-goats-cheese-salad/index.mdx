## Tinned Tuna And Goats' Cheese Salad

This recipe of Tinned Tuna And Goats' Cheese Salad is a great way to use those tinned tuna packs that hang around on the shelf.

If your kitchen is anything like mine, tinned tuna tends to be left at the back of the cupboard after everything else has gone. Not that tinned tuna tastes terrible; it tastes great, but it lacks that 'Yeah!' factor when considering lunch options.

_'Shall we have tinned tuna for lunch today, dear?'_

See what I mean?

Well, this salad is the way to make tinned tuna more interesting. So the next time you're at the supermarket, grab a small pack of goats' cheese and some essential low-carb salad items and prepare to be wowed.
