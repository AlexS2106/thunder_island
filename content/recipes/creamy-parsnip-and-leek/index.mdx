  - ½ tbsp lard
  - 2.5 cm fresh ginger 
  - 1 x clove garlic

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Peel and dice the parsnips.
  - Cut off the base and the green leaves of the leek and discard. 
  - Slice the white part of the leek.
  - Grate the ginger.
  - Crush the garlic

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Heat the lard in a large frying pan over medium heat (I use the number 5).
  - **Step 2**
    - Fry the parsnips until soft, and stir regularly.
  - **Step 3**
    - Add the leek and fry till soft.
  - **Step 4**
    - Add the ginger and garlic. Stir in for 2 mins.
  - **Step 5**
    - Add the lemon juice, curry powder, salt, pepper, chicken (or vegetable stock cube) and coconut cream. Stir in.
    - Turn the heat down to a simmer (I use the number 3).
  - **Step 6**
    - For a side dish, skip this step.
    - For a soup instead of a side dish, add ½ cup of water at room temperature.
    - Lightly blitz with a handheld blender.
  - **Step 7**
    - Simmer for 15 mins.
  - **Step 8**
    - Serve.
