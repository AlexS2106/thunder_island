description: Four tasty ultra-thin crust large margherita pizzas - a family copycat-takeouts made at home. Everyone prefers them to the store-bought ones, and this way we can afford to have Saturday night pizza every weekend.

<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- **For the dough**
  - 450 g flour plus extra for dusting
  - 250 ml warm water
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1.5 tsp active yeast
- **For the topping**
  - 12 tbsp passata
  - 1 kg mozzarella cheese

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

- Allow 1-hour rising time

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Mix the flour, salt and yeast.
- **Step 2**
  - Add the water and mix.
- **Step 3**
  - Knead the dough to mix the ingredients.
- **Step 4**
  - Leave to rise for 1 hour.
- **Step 5**
  - Preheat the oven to 200Â°C, use either the pizza setting or the fan-assisted setting.
- **Step 6**
  - Split the dough into four equal pieces.
- **Step 7**
  - Roll out one piece of the dough until it is about 12 - 13 inches in diameter.
  - Transfer the dough to a perforated pizza baking tray before adding the toppings - the dough is fragile and difficult to transfer later.
  - Spoon on 3 tbsp of the passata and spread evenly over all the dough.
  - Sprinkle 250 g of the cheese evenly over the pizza.
- **Step 8**
  - Repeat **Step 7** until you have four pizzas.
- **Step 9**
  - Bake in the oven for 10 mins.
- **Step 10**
  - Slice the pizzas and serve.
