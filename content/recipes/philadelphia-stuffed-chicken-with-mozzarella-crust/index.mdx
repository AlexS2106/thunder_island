<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 2 x 175g (2 medium) chicken breasts
  - 50 g Philadelphia
  - 50 g shredded mozzarella
  - ½ tsp salt
  - ½ tsp black pepper
  - ¼ tsp dried chives
  - ¼ tsp dried tarragon

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 200°C.
  - **Step 2**
    - Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
  - **Step 3**
    - In a small bowl, mix the Philadelphia, chives and tarragon.
  - **Step 4**
    - Slice sideways through each chicken breast to create a large *pocket*.
    - Push half the Philadelphia mixture into the *pocket* of each chicken breast.
    - Smooth down the outer flesh of the chicken to seal the *pocket*.
  - **Step 5**
    - Place the chicken breasts on a baking tray and cook for 20 mins.
    - Remove the chicken breasts from the oven and sprinkle the shredded mozzarella on top.
    - Return the chicken breasts to the oven for 5 more mins until the mozzarella has melted and turned slightly brown.
    - Remove from the oven when the chicken is cooked: a meat thermometer should read 75°C, and juices should run clear.
  - **Step 6**
    - Serve.
