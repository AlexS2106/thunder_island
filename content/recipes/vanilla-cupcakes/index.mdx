Credit for these vanilla cupcakes does not belong to me. The original is on my favourite website called [Bbcgoodfoods](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com) as [Easy Vanilla Cupcakes](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/easy-vanilla-cupcakes).

Why is it my favourite website? 'Ços I can't get a recipe without wading through a ton of waffle! Sometimes, among the pictures, the blah, blah, blah and the huge number of ads, it's a mystery where the recipe is.
