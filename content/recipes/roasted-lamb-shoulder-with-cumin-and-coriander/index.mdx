### Ingredients

- 1.2 kg boneless lamb shoulder
- 2 tbsp oil
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp dried coriander
- 1 tsp dried cumin

- ½ tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp mustard powder

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

- Remove the lamb from the fridge about 1 hour before cooking to warm up.

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 150°C.
- **Step 2**
  - In a bowl, mix the oil, salt, black pepper, coriander, cumin, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and mustard powder.
  - Rub the oil/spice mix over the whole lamb.
- **Step 3**
  - Melt the lard in a medium frying pan on the hob on high heat. (Number 9.)
  - When the lard is sizzling, place the lamb in the frying pan.
  - Slowly turn the lamb and sear all sides of the meat.
  - When the lamb is browned, place it on a roasting tray.
  - Keep the pan for the next step.
- **Step 4**
  - Remove the frying pan from the heat and allow it to cool.
  - Add the apple cider vinegar to the pan and scrape around the pan's base to get any brown bits left behind.
  - Pour the vinegar and scraped bits over the top of the lamb.
- **Step 5**
  - Cover the lamb with the aluminium foil; try to avoid the foil from touching the top of the lamb, and roast for 3 hours.
- **Step 6**
  - Remove the lamb from the oven, don't uncover it, and let it rest for 20 mins inside the foil.
- **Step 7**
  - Serve.
