<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Chill for 1 hour. See **Step 1**.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Whisk the flour, milk, eggs, and salt in a bowl and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.
  - **Step 2**
    - Add the lard to a 25cm x 25cm baking pan with high sides and place it in the oven.
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 220°C.
  - **Step 3**
    - When the oven is hot, remove the Yorkshire pudding mix from the fridge and briefly whisk again.
    - Remove the baking pan from the oven; the lard should be sizzling now. Immediately pour in the pudding mixture.
    - Return the pan to the top of the oven and cook for 15 mins.
  - **Step 4**
    - When the 15 mins are up, turn the oven down to 180°C; open the oven door for a minute to help it cool faster.
    - At 180°C, cook for a further 15 mins.
  - **Step 5**
    - Cut into 4 pieces to serve.
