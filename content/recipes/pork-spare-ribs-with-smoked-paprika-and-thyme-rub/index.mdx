## Pork Ribs

Pork Ribs With Smoked Paprika And Thyme Rub is one of the more simple carnivore recipes because you cannot beat a big chunk of meat for sheer tummy satisfaction! 

The keto diet inspired this recipe, but it is also suitable for whole30 and the carnivore diet. Previously, I only had one recipe for spare ribs and a rather honey-laden one at that, so an alternative was necessary.

### Use Any Herbs

You can use any combination of herbs you like instead of those I suggested - think of this recipe as a place to start experimenting. The simplicity of the ingredients also lets you neglect the meat in the oven, and it will still turn out great.

### Spare Ribs Versus Baby Back Ribs

Spare ribs tend to have less meat than their beefier (porkier?) alternative, baby back ribs. However, spare ribs are the cheaper of the two and, we also find, the tastier. One spare rib usually gives about 225g of meat without the bones making half about 110g of meat per person. If you prefer more meat on your plate at a sitting, double the recipe and make one rib per person instead.
