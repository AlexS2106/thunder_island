### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Marinate the chicken. (See **Step 1**)
  - Remove the chicken from the fridge about half an hour before cooking.   

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Add the chicken breasts and all the marinating ingredients together.
    - Leave in the fridge to marinate for 4 hours.
  - **Step 2**
    - Melt the ghee in a medium saucepan on medium-high heat. (I use the number 7.)
  - **Step 3**
    - When the ghee is hot, add the chicken. 
    - Discard any remaining marinade.
    - Cook the chicken for 1 min on one side, flip it over, and cook for 1 min on the other.
    - Flip the chicken again and continue to cook for a further 4 mins on each side.
    - The chicken is cooked when the juices run clear or a meat thermometer reads 75°C.
    - Remove from the pan, cover and rest for 5 mins.
  - **Step 4**
    - Serve.
