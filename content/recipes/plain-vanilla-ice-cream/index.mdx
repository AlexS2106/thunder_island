<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 500 ml cream
- 350 ml milk
- 200 g sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla essence

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Whisk the cream until stiff.
- **Step 2**
  - In a separate bowl, whisk the milk, sugar, and vanilla essence until the sugar is mixed in.
- **Step 3**
  - Whisk the vanilla mixture into the whipped cream until fully incorporated.
- **Step 4**
  - Make the ice cream according to the ice cream machine instructions, for us this means turn it on, pour in and churn for 25 mins.
  - _NOTE_ Our icecream machine is slightly small for this recipe and while it can take all of it, it works better with two churnings. The second churning taking place 24 hours after the first to allow the tub to fully refreeze.
- **Step 6**
  - Serve immediately as a sloppy or place in the freezer for a couple of hours.
