## Low Carb Cottage Pie

Cottage Pie has been revamped into this new svelte version!

Upon being faced with this culinary magic, my resident taste tester and current dieter, aka _the husband_ declared. 'Oo! It's really nice. What did you do?' With such praise, this Cottage Pie became a keeper.

Unfortunately, one of us is lactose intolerant – damn it! – and cannot indulge. I did try it without the cheeses, but it sadly lacks _'pizzazz'_ of any kind.

### British Pies

Pies are so quintessentially British that we have managed to make pie eating into an art form. You can't beat a good 'ole pie. Who says British food is boring? And let this statement lead me into making the rest of this post a history lesson for no particular reason other than 'All knowledge is worth having.' [*Cite Anafiel Delauney from Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey.] This fantastic book is not for the faint of heart or under 18's.\* But, let me not digress and return to the no less fantastic but much less age-reserved history of British cuisine.

#### The History Of The Cottage Pie

Historically, cottage pie was a pie of any meat topped with potatoes. This obviously was after potatoes were introduced in the late 16th century. The folk of Britain soon discovered they were easy to grow and incredibly cheap. As such, they were quickly adopted into British cuisine and became a staple of home cooking in houses of the poor. The poor at the time lived in tiny houses called cottages. Hence, the Cottage Pie came into being.

##### Naming The Pies

We British, obviously, do not like any culinary surprises whatsoever and would prefer to know what we are about to consume in advance. Ever helpful with descriptive communication, the English language came to the rescue and allowed us to adapt our pie names. A lamb cottage pie became a shepherd's pie because shepherds care for sheep - excellent image association going on there. Along the same vein, a pie with fish inside became, quite sensibly, a fisherman's pie. A pie with chicken became a chicken pie – admittedly, that one lacks originality. All this descriptive naming freed the term cottage pie to be used exclusively for beef. Perhaps, because Britain lacked cowboys and ranchers for a cowboy's pie or a rancher's pie? Whatever the reason, now you know that when you are faced with cottage pie, it will, or **should** contain beef.

##### Secret Ingredients

Throughout the country, British cooks have their traditional, often proudly announced unique and special pie herb set. This herb set quite obviously makes _a cottage pie far superior to 'Mabel's' next door_!

Veggies, however, are not so special. They tend to be what's in the kitchen and available to use, probably because we don't want to go to the shops because it's raining outside!

### The End

This particular recipe is designed to keep carbs to a minimum. Enjoy it as it is, or feel free to add whatever veggies are in your kitchen.
