<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 2 x 750 g pork shanks, bone-in
  - ½ tbsp lard
  - ½ tsp salt
  - ½ beef stock cube
  - 120 ml water

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 150°C.
  - **Step 2**
    - Dry both pork shanks with kitchen paper and rub on all sides with the salt.
  - **Step 3**
    - Melt the lard in a frying pan on the hob on high heat. (I use the number 8 or 9.)
  - **Step 4**
    - When the lard is shimmering, add the pork shanks and brown on all sides - you might need to hold the shanks in place with some tongs.
    - When the shanks are browned, place them on a baking tray.
    - Keep the frying pan for the next step.
  - **Step 5**
    - Remove the frying pan from the hob and let the pan cool a little.
    - Add the water and beef stock cube to the pan. Scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan to mix into the water, and the residual heat from the pan should also melt the stock cube.
    - Pour the stock over the pork shanks.
  - **Step 5**
    - Cover the tray with aluminium foil, and form a tight seal on all sides.
  - **Step 6**
    - Cook the pork shanks in the oven undisturbed for 3 hours.
  - **Step 7**
    - Serve with its juices.

## Shanks, Ribs And Other Big Meats

Before I first started cooking, I mean before I really started cooking with actual ingredients, instead of unpackaging things and putting them in the oven, I was too intimidated to cook the 'big' meats. The pork shanks, lamb shanks, French rack of ribs, pretty much anything that was an oval piece of meat. Nowadays, with the economy what it is and getting worse, it's budget over everything else. If it's cheap, I buy it and try it.

### How To Cook Meat

Let me share a secret: there are only two ways to cook meat. Take a big lump of meat, any meat, and it will be soft and juicy after three hours at 150°C.  Take a small lump of meat, any meat, and it takes 20 mins at 200°C. Everything else is just a variation on a theme.
