description: A homemade version of chicken kiev that can use breast or thigh. It tastes just as good, if not better, as the slice a pocket in the breast way that I find impossible to get right and gave up on a long long time. Carl prefers the keto version of this.

<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 800g chicken mince
- ½ tbsp ghee/butter
- 80 g greek yoghurt
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- 4 tsp butter
- 1 x clove garlic (large)
- 1 egg
- 100 g panko breadcrumbs
- oil

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

- Crush the garlic.
- Chill the butter.
- Whisk the egg with a fork and leave in a bowl.
- Place the breadcrumbs into a bowl.

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Add the chicken, yoghurt, salt and black pepper to a food processor.
  - Pulse into a smooth mousse.
- **Step 2**
  - Divide the meat mousse into 4 equal portions.
  - Divide the garlic into 4 equal portions.
  - Divide the butter into 4 equal portions.
- **Step 3**
  - Roll one portion into a ball and press into a disc until about finger width.
  - Place 1 portion of butter and 1 portion of garlic into the chicken disc.
  - Curve the sides of the chicken disc up and smooth over the top of the butter and garlic. The end result will be a disc-shaped chicken mush.
- **Step 4**
  - Dip the chicken ball into the egg and then into the breadcrumbs.
- **Step 5**
  - Heat the oil in a frying pan on a high heat. (Number 8.)
  - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 180°C.
- **Step 6**
  - Place the chicken kievs into the oil and fry until brown on both sides, this should take around 3-4 mins on each side. It's easier to turn them over with 2 forks but, at the end, take them out with a fish slice.
- **Step 7**
  - Place the kievs onto a baking sheet on a baking tray and place into the centre of the oven.
  - Cook for 18 mins, without turning them.
- **Step 8**
  - Serve.
