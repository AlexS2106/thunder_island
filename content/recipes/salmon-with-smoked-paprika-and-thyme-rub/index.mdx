<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 2 x 200 g salmon fillet
  - 1 tsp lard
  - ½ tsp salt
  - ½ tsp ground black pepper
  - ½ tsp smoked paprika
  - ½ tsp dried thyme

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Remove the fish from the fridge about 15 mins before cooking to warm up.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Pat dry the salmon.
    - Mix all the herbs into a small bowl.
    - Rub evenly over the fish.
  - **Step 2**
    - Melt the lard in a medium size frying pan on medium-high heat. (I use the number 7.)
  - **Step 3**
    - When the lard is hot, add both salmon fillets, skin side down.
    - Fry for one minute, flip the fillets over, then fry for another minute.
    - Flip the salmon fillets back onto the skin side again and fry for 4 mins.
    - Flip them over for a final time, and fry for another 4 mins.
  - **Step 4**
    - Serve.
