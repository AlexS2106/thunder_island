<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 200 g (Â¼ head) cauliflower

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

- Place the cauliflower in a food processor and pulse until it resembles fine grains.
- A whole cauliflower can be predone and the cauliflower rice kept in the freezer for use as needed.

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Place the cauliflower on a microwaveable plate.
- **Step 2**
  - Zap on full power for 1 min.
- **Step 3**
  - It smells a bit funny just out of the microwave but add the main recipe on top and it's a decent low calorie and grain free alternative to rice.

</Instructions>
