## Sea Bream Recipe

### Sea Breams In Malta

Sea Bream Stuffed With Tomatoes and Shallots is a recipe for my Mum, who loves, but rarely gets, fresh fish dinner. The sea bream is a locally produced fish farmed in Maltese fishing waters. It is relatively cheap on the island, so I can afford an experiment or two when my parents visit. This particular experiment was a roaring success.

### Sea Bream Weight

There are plenty of different ways to cook sea bream out there, each one more fabulous than the next. This recipe is one of the simpler ones and is best for average size sea bream of about 400 – 450g.

### Sea Bream Cooking Times

Most recipes for sea bream have a cooking time of around 15-20 minutes, and fish tend to dry out if overcooked. However, personal experience has given me undercooked fish far, _far_ more often than overcooked ones. And so, for mine, I always give 30 minutes.
