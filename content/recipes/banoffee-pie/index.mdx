<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 150 g milk chocolate digestives
- 90 g butter
- 400 g (1 can) Carnation caramel
- 3 x bananas
- 280 ml Elmlea double cream
- 1 x square chocolate

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

- Break the biscuits up in the food processor or using a rolling pin.
- Melt the butter to a liquid; make sure it doesn't cook.

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Mix the biscuits and the butter to form a paste-like mixture.
- **Step 2**
  - Use the back of a spoon to flatten the biscuit mixture into the base of a baking tin about 23cm wide.
  - Place the tin with the biscuit mix into the fridge and leave to harden for 1 hour.
- **Step 3**
  - Spoon the Carnation caramel over the now hardened biscuit base and spread it around to cover the biscuits evenly.
- **Step 4**
  - Thickly slice all 3 bananas.
  - Place them on top of the caramel in a single layer.
  - Start on the outside and make a circular pattern towards the centre.
  - This will take almost all of the 3 bananas with a tiny bit of banana left over.
- **Step 5**
  - Whip the cream.
  - Spoon the whipped cream evenly onto the bananas.
- **Step 6**
  - Grate the square of chocolate onto the top of the cream.
- **Step 7**
  - Serve immediately or keep in a fridge.
