### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Finely slice the cucumber.
  - Peel, de-core and dice the apple.

  - Crush the garlic.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 200°C.
  - **Step 2**
    - Prepare a baking tray with baking paper.
    - Beat the chicken breasts to about 2-3 cm thickness.

    - Place the chicken onto the baking paper and pour any excess mixture over the top.
  - **Step 3**
    - Cook the chicken for 20 mins in the oven until the juices run clear.
  - **Step 4**
    - While the chicken is cooking, place the pine nuts in a frying pan over medium heat.
    - Stir often to prevent the nuts from over-browning or burning on one side.
    - In 10 mins or less, they will be slightly browned, remove them from the heat and set aside.
  - **Step 5**
    - When the chicken is cooked, cut it into bite-sized pieces.
  - **Step 6**
    - Add the chicken and the salad ingredients to a large bowl.
    - Mix everything together
  - **Step 7**
    - In a small bowl, mix the vinaigrette ingredients.
    - Pour the vinaigrette over the salad.
