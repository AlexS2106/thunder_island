## About Pork Stir Fry

Pork Stir Fry was an accidental recipe of 'things I need to use up', which tasted very nice.

### Pork Medallions

I primarily use pork medallions in this dish because they are among the most common cuts in the Maltese butcher shops but replace this with anything you like.

Pork lends best to flash-frying, so don't be afraid to turn the heat up and ensure you don't overcook it.

### Carrots

I use a spiraliser to give the carrots a more noodle-like appearance and a more authentic-looking stir fry overall. The thin spirals also cook quicker to keep up with the other ingredients. You can grate or chop the carrots if you do not have a spiraliser. However, if you happen to chop them, precooking them in a microwave for 1 minute or two to soften them before cooking is a good idea.

### Frozen Veggies

Another thing I often do is use frozen veggies to make the stir fry: presliced mixed bell peppers and onion. The resulting veggies end up a little softer, but it tastes the same and makes things easier.

### Ghee

I use ghee as my go-to fat to cook in because I like the additional buttery flavour without the lactose. However, it's not essential to the stir fry, so feel free to use another oil or fat to suit.

### Dried Herbs

Anyone who has gone through my recipes will know I prefer using dried herbs. Why? Because they take a long time to go off and save me money! Fresh herbs have their place, but dried herbs make life easier; if you prefer fresh, swap them in.

#### Cumin

One of the dominant herbs in this recipe is cumin. I admit to a love-hate relationship with cumin, the taste of cumin can very quickly become overpowering. It goes from can't taste it to way too much in a heartbeat, and then all you have is cumin. This recipe uses the perfect amount for me; for you, it might be too little or too much, but the entire recipe is flexible - adjust to suit.
