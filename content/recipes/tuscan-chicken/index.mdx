## Making Your Very Own Sun-Dried Tomatoes

The make-you-own method of sun-dried tomatoes takes some time but is a sure way to a purer, more health-friendly ingredient. Or, perhaps, you want to try making it all from scratch!

<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 400 g cherry tomatoes
- pinch salt

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

- Cut the cherry tomatoes in half.

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 110°C.
- **Step 2**
  - Line a baking tray with baking paper.
  - Place the cherry tomatoes cut side upwards on the baking paper.
  - Sprinkle the tomatoes with salt.
- **Step 3**
  - Place the tray in the centre of the oven.
  - Leave to cook for 3 hours.
  - Check occasionally from about 2 hours onwards to ensure the tomatoes are not burning.

##### Notes

When the sun-dried tomatoes are cool and if you are not using them straight away, store them covered in olive oil.

Even if you want to use them straight away, adding a tablespoon of olive oil moistens and improves their taste.
