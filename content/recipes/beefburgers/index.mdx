### Instructions

#### Preparation

- Finely dice the onion.

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Melt the butter in a medium frying pan on a high heat. (Number 8.)
  - Add the chopped onion and fry, stirring often, until the onions are soft and just starting to blacken.
  - Remove the pan from the heat.
- **Step 2**
  - In a large bowl, mix the beef mince, egg, salt, pepper and mixed herbs.
  - When the onions are cool enough to handle, add them to the bowl as well.
  - Squish the burger mixture through your fingers until the texture becomes smooth and soft.
  - Divide the mixture into 4.
  - Roughly shape each portion into a burger - they will be delicate.
- **Step 3**
  - Melt the butter in a large frying pan on a medium heat. (Number 7.)
- **Step 4**
  - When the butter is hot add the burger carefully.
  - Fry the burgers on one side for 4 mins, carefully turn them over, and fry on the other side for 3 mins.
  - Check to see if they are done, if not return to the heat and fry for longer.
- **Step 5**
  - Serve.
