<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 450 g sausage meat or 16 thin sausages
- 375 g plain flour
- 150 g butter
- 1 tsp salt
- 6 tbsp water
- 1 egg

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 200°C.
- **Step 2**
  - In a food processor, mix the flour, salt and butter.
  - Add the water slowly until the dough comes together.
- **Step 3**
  - Lay the dough on a clean surface and knead it into a lump.
  - Roll out the dough until it's about ½ cm thick.
- **Step 4**
  - Add the sausage or meat to the centre, and cut away the excess - I use a pizza cutter for this bit. Roll until the meat is covered with a little extra flap of pastry at the end.
  - Repeat until all the sausages are in rolls.
- **Step 5**
  - Using a pastry brush, brush the extra flap of pastry with water and stick it down.
  - Repeat with all the sausage rolls.
- **Step 6**
  - Place the sausage rolls in a baking tin.
  - Mix the egg in a bowl, and use the pastry brush to coat each roll with the egg wash.
- **Step 7**
  - Bake for 25 mins.
- **Step 8**
  - Serve hot or cold.
