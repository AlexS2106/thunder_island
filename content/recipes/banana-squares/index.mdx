## Sweet Banana Squares

Sometimes, you want something sweet - enter banana squares! I love this recipe, but more senior members of my family aren't too fond of this recipe because 'warm bananas just aren't right'. The culinary success of Banana Squares seems to depend on whether you like warm bananas or not.

## Banana History

For this post, you are getting a history lesson! Just what you always wanted... Want to know about the history of the Gros Michel banana? No? Well, I will be informing you anyway, but with humorousness and sarcasm, which will, hopefully, amuse you for erm... about 2 minutes.

### The Big Michael

Did you know the bananas we eat now are not the bananas we used to eat? Shock, horror! They sneaked that one past us all, didn't they? So, let me un-sneak the whole sordid affair, just for entertainment through a blog post, and tell you how the big Michaels drooped.

Some years ago, we, the sentient beings of the human race, who, of sound mind and body, were and are quite prepared to consign ourselves to oblivion in our ongoing quest to destroy the planet we live on, decided, in our wisdom, to refine the world's bananas down to just one type.

_It really makes you wonder how the powers that be didn't see this problem coming!_

#### The Tastiest Banana

Obviously, this one type of banana was the tastiest, and its name was… the Gros Michel. The big Michael. Such an interesting name for a banana, don't you think? Let us ponder for a moment the phallic nature of the banana and bet ourselves whether it was a man or a woman who thought that particular name up? One also wonders what they were doing at the time!

Back to it! The Gros Michel was the banana of bananas! Apparently, the wishy-washy bananas of today cannot even compare. It was such a delicious banana; that's all we ate, and that's all that was planted. Field after field of Gros Michel banana trees. Do you see the problem approaching?

Delicious years pass by, and the banana industry is booming. Money, money everywhere!

The wonder that is nature, which loves evolution, diversity and survival of the fittest, turned its attention to these oh-so-identical banana trees and laughed. It was a very evil laugh! Mwahahaaaa!

### Up Pops The Fungus!

Up pops a little fungus. This ever so simple yet ever so powerful organism, and what does it like to eat more than anything else? Yep, you guessed it – delicious Gros Michel banana trees.

### The Big Michaels Are Drooping

The fungus starts to munch, and it's got fields and fields and fields of fungal heaven. The banana trees get sick, super sick. The Big Michaels are drooping.

### The Cavendish

No more banana trees meant no more tasty bananas. What to do? What to do? Think fast! Over in little old England, there was, very luckily, another banana. It was not so tasty, not so great, but it was a banana, at least! It was... The Cavendish. Such a very austere, English-type name, don't you think? We English are good at naming stuff – Cock Alley, Titty-Ho, the River Piddle. It's not just banana growers who can think up great names.

### Saved!

"We are saved! We are saved!" Say the banana growers. There was a mad rush. Human versus fungus! People went bananas planting Cavendish bananas trees and said a sad goodbye to the Gros Michel. People still have bananas to eat. Yippee!!

### Or Maybe Not...

Ah! But who has the power in the war between humans and nature? Because, my dear banana students, that is not the end of my story. No, no, no! You see, without the Gros Michel to feed on, our little fungus still wants to eat bananas and right there is, you guessed it -The Cavendish.

Makes you wonder what bananas we will have in a few more years, perhaps none at all. Imagine, if you will, a banana-less world. No banana quiche, no banoffee pie! Disaster!
