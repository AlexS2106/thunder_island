### Instructions

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 175°C or 350°F.
  - Line a baking tray with baking paper.
- **Step 2**
  - Mix the almond flour, eggs, 1½ tbsp of butter and salt together to form a sticky pastry.
  - Divide the pastry into six parts.
- **Step 3**
  - Take two squares of clingfilm and lay one square down.
  - Roll one part of the pastry into a cylinder and place it on the clingfilm.
  - Lay the second square of clingfilm over the pastry.
  - Use your rolling pin to roll over the top of the second clingfilm until the pastry is big enough to wrap around a sausage, plus an extra 2cm (about ¾ inch) to form a lip.
  - Remove the top layer of clingfilm, and place your sausage at one edge.
  - Use the clingfilm at the bottom to smooth the pastry around the sausage.
  - Wrap the pastry around the sausage, pick up the sausage and smooth the lip of the pastry over the other side to keep the pastry sealed.
  - Place the completed sausage roll onto the baking paper.
  - Repeat for each sausage.
  - See below for more in-depth help rolling the sausages up.
- **Step 4**

## Making Almond Flour Sausage Rolls Step by Step

I've included some more detailed instructions because rolling the sausage rolls can be tricky until you get used to it.

### Measure Out The Pastry

This recipe is just enough for ten small sausages, six medium-sized, or four large sausages with little to nothing left over. It is best to divide the pastry into these amounts before beginning to eliminate a problem arising at the last sausage. I eyeball the pastry amounts, but if you aren't sure, weigh it out, whatever is easiest.

### Use Clingfilm

The next step is to cut two small squares of clingfilm, which I believe is called plastic wrap or saran wrap in America. Lay one square of clingfilm on a flat surface and roll one portion of the pastry between your hands into an oblong shape before placing it onto the clingfilm. Place the second piece of clingfilm on top.

A small side note for those thinking of ditching this step is that the clingfilm is necessary. Until I included the clingfilm, it was a torturous nightmare to get the pastry to stick to the sausage, not the rolling pin. Until now, I still haven't been able to think of another way to make this recipe that doesn't involve clingfilm.

### Roll The Pastry

Use a rolling pin and roll out the pastry to roughly the width of your sausage. Make it long enough to wrap around the sausage, plus about 1-2 cm extra for the length - the spare is because the pastry will contract a bit when baking. Without this extra pastry, the roll will pull apart. If it does, it will still taste just as fabulous, but we might as well aim for aesthetically pleasing. Trim away extra pastry with a knife, pull it away and add it to another pastry portion instead.

### Make The Sausage Rolls

Once you are confident in the size and shape of the pastry you've flattened, place your sausage at one end and roll it around the sausage. Again, use the clingfilm to do this, or else the pastry will stick to your hands. Finally, press down a little on your pastry seam to seal the sausage roll.

Transfer your newly rolled Sausage Roll onto a lined baking tray.

Rinse and repeat.
