### Instructions

#### Preparation

- Remove the steak from the fridge about 15 mins before cooking.
- Calculate the steak cooking time:

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Melt the ghee/butter in a frying pan on medium-high heat. (Number 7.)
- **Step 2**
  - Pat the steaks dry with kitchen paper.
  - Rub salt and pepper onto all sides.
- **Step 3**
  - When the pan is hot, add the steaks.
  - Time the meat - don't guess. (See _Preparation_)
  - When the timer finishes, turn the steaks and reset the timer.
  - When the timer rings the second time, it's all done.
- **Step 4**
  - Serve the steak in the pan juices.
