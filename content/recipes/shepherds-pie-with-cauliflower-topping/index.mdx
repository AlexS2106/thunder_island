### Instructions

#### Preparation
  - Finely chop the fennel
  - Chop the broccoli.
  - Peel, top, tail, and chop the courgette.
  - Chop the cauliflower.
  - Crush the garlic cloves.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Pre-heat a fan-assisted oven to 200°C.
  - **Step 2**
    - Put a saucepan of water on the hob; when it boils, add the broccoli and cook till soft, about 15 mins.
  - **Step 3**
    - While the broccoli is cooking, melt the duck fat in a frying pan over medium-high heat. (I use the number 7.)
    - Add the fennel and fry till soft, about 5-10 mins.
    - Add the ground lamb and fry until browned, about 10 mins.
  - **Step 4**
    - When the broccoli is soft, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the water and add it to the frying pan; keep the saucepan of water for **Step 5**.  
    - Add the courgette to the frying pan.
    - Add all the remaining ingredients for the mince: the coconut flour, parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, black pepper, white vinegar, garlic cloves, tomato puree and chicken stock.
    - Stir well.
  - **Step 5**
    - Add the cauliflower to the saucepan of water and boil for about 15 mins, until soft.
  - **Step 6**
    - Transfer the mince from the frying pan to a casserole dish of about 23cm x 23cm. 
    - Smooth the meat into one even layer.
  - **Step 7**
    - When the cauliflower is soft, pour out the water and add the cauliflower back into the saucepan onto the heat; stir often to evaporate any excess water. Be careful that the cauliflower does not burn. 
    - Remove from the heat and allow the cauliflower to cool slightly.
    - Place the cauliflower into a food processor and add the butter, salt, pepper and coconut cream. 
    - Blitz everything until smooth.
    - Pour the cauliflower mix on top of the mince and use a spoon or spatula to smooth it into one layer covering the mince.
  - **Step 8**
    - Place the casserole dish in the centre of the oven for 20 – 25 mins.
  - **Optional**
    - If you want to add some cheese, sprinkle it over the cauliflower mash about 10 mins from the end.
  - *Step 9**
    - Serve.
