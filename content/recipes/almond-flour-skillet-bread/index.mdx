##The Advantages Of Low Carb Skillet Bread

Low Carb Skillet Bread is simple, fast and filling, made with the fewest possible ingredients. The ingredients are measured with a tablespoon or half of one for speed and easy clean-up; everything can be thrown into a bowl in any particular order. This means it's excellent for a weeknight dinner when time and energy are in short supply. It's super easy to make; if you can flip an omelette, you can make this skillet bread. And, did I mention it's very filling? You'll feel like you've eaten a good dinner afterwards.

## Don't Reduce The Ghee

It is tempting to reduce or remove the ghee from the ingredient list; unfortunately, the ghee is necessary. Coconut flour is super absorbent and will soak up everything. I found that ½ tbsp of the ghee was the _exact_ amount needed to prevent sticking but not be wasteful.

## Use The Low Carb Skillet Bread Like Naan Bread

When using this bread, try to think of it as a slice of naan bread. It won't wrap a burger or hold your sandwich spread, but it will soak up your curry or deliciously bulk up your stew. Those who lived their entire lives having slices of white bread with every meal might find this an acceptable alternative for the job.

## Feel Free To Add In

I left this flatbread recipe quite plain. I always like to give the simplest recipe versions first with experiments later but adding some rosemary and thyme, garlic, or even a little cinnamon and honey are tasty embellishments.
