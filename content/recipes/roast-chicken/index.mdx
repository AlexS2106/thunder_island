<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 1 x whole chicken without giblets
- 2 tbsp ghee/butter

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

- Remove the chicken from the fridge 1 hour before cooking.
- Calculate the chicken cooking time: 20 mins each for every 450g plus an extra 20 mins.

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 200Â°C.
- **Step 2**
  - Place a roasting tray in the oven with the butter for 5 mins.
- **Step 3**
  - Place the chicken on the roasting tray breast side up, spoon the now melted butter over the chicken and place the chicken back in the oven.
  - Set the timer for the calculated time. (See _Preparation_)
- **Optional**
  - Baste the chicken in the middle of cooking if you wish, don't if you don't want to bother. The difference between doing and not doing isn't so much.
- **Step 4**
  - When the time is up, remove the chicken from the oven. It's cooked if the juices run clear; to be sure, use a meat thermometer.
  - Wrap the chicken in a couple of layers of aluminium foil and leave it for 20 mins.
- **Optional**
  - Use the juices left in the pan to make an exceptionally delicious gravy.
  - Scrape all the bits from the tray and pour everything into the measuring jug, including all the fat. Top up the rest with water as per the gravy instructions, and then add the gravy granules.
  - Blend everything together with a handheld blender.
- **Step 5**
  - Unwrap the chicken, cut and serve.
  - Pour over the gravy if you have chosen to make it.
