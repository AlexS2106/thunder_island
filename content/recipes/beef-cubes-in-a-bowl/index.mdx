## A Bowl Of Meat

A bowl of beef cubes is my alternative to the recent rise of vegetarianism and veganism, 'the buddha bowl'. For those who have yet to encounter the 'buddha bowl', it's a bowl piled high with different veggies, filling and delicious. Unfortunately, however, it has no meat. While the animal lover in me would really like to be vegetarian, the real me requires meat sustenance. Cue this carnivorous alternative!

### Shift And Slow Cookers

Having spent year upon year as a shift worker, I know it is almost impossible to eat healthily when working shifts. What helped me a lot, however, was a slow cooker. A slow cooker is worth its weight in gold! This is a meal I developed specifically for the slow cooker. 

#### A Shift Worker's Scenario

You prep your healthy veggies and protein-filled meat. In fact, you do everything before work when you have plenty of time. You turn on the slow cooker as you walk out the door to work.

Whilst you wish, with sadness and longing, that you were anywhere else but at work, at home, that slow cooker is doing its magic. The meat is softening and becoming juicy and delicious. Those veggies are marinating in that delicious liquid. The stock mixes with oozings from the meat and veggies. 

Remember, this is what awaits you as your shift finally ends.

Then, at the end of work, instead of thinking. 'I am hungry, I want food, but I am too tired to cook.' You can, instead, think to yourself. 'Aha! I have a wonderful, tasty dinner waiting for me at home.'

Such a thought lets you drive past that all-night garage with its ready-made pastries, crisps and chocolate bars that you have spent a small fortune in. Such a thought will stop you from heading to the all-night supermarket for calorie-laden pizza. Such a thought will send you directly home with all of its comforts. 

This delicious smell greets you at home, a warm embrace as you walk through the door. You're tired and don't have much time to sleep before you have to get up again for the next shift, but here is this ready and waiting, tasty, delicious and healthy hot meal. 

As you climb into your comfy pj's 10 minutes later, your tummy is full, your taste buds are satisfied, and your body is satiated. All this and it was healthy too!
