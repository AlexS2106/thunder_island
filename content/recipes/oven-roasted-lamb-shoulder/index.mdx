description: A traditional rosemary recipe for a slow-cooked-in-the-oven lamb shoulder. The result is tender and juicy. While the majority of lamb recipes tend to be easier in a slow cooker, the roasted flavour in this recipe is better oven-baked.

<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 1.6 kg boneless lamb shoulder
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp dried rosemary
- ¼ tsp garlic powder
- ¼ tsp black pepper

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

- Remove the lamb from the fridge for 1 hour to warm it to room temperature.

#### Method

- **Step 1**
  - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 150°C.
- **Step 2**
  - Pat the lamb dry with kitchen paper and pierce it several times with a sharp knife.
- **Step 3**
  - In a small bowl, mix the salt, garlic powder, black pepper and olive oil.
  - Rub the herbed oil over the lamb, and cover all sides.
- **Step 4**
  - Place the lamb on a baking tray and sprinkle the top with dried rosemary.
  - Cover the tray with aluminium foil; try to make sure the foil doesn't touch the lamb itself.
- **Step 3**
  - Roast in the oven for 2 ½ hours.
  - Take the lamb from the oven and remove the aluminium foil but keep the foil to one side to use later.
  - Return the uncovered lamb to the oven and cook for a further 30 minutes.
- **Step 4**
  - Remove the lamb when cooked - a meat thermometer should read above 63°C. If it doesn't, return the lamb to the oven and check again in 30 mins.
  - Once cooked, wrap the meat tightly in the aluminium foil set aside earlier and leave it to rest for 30 mins.
- **Step 5**
  - Serve.
