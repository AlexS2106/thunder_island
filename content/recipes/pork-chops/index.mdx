<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 2 x 85 g (2 thin-cut) bone-in pork chops 
  - 3 tbsp lard
  - ½ tsp salt
  - ½ tsp black pepper
  - ½ tsp sweet paprika
  - ½ tsp curry powder

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Remove the pork chops from the fridge 15 minutes before cooking.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Mix the salt, pepper, paprika and curry powder and rub onto both sides of the pork chops.
  - **Step 2**
    - Melt the lard in a medium-sized frying pan over medium-high heat. (I use the number 7.)
  - **Step 3**
    - Add the pork chops to the pan when the lard starts sizzling.
    - Fry the pork chops for 3 minutes on one side, flip them over and fry for 2 minutes on the other. 
    - The meat is cooked when the juices run clear: a meat thermometer should read 62°C.
  - **Step 4**
    - Wrap the cooked pork chops in aluminium foil and leave for 5 mins.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve.
