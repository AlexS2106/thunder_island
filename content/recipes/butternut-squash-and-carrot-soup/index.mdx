## Butternut Squash And Carrot Soup

### In The Beginning

Butternut Squash and Carrot Soup came into existence when the case of the 'sniffles' got passed around the family. Those tiny culprits responsible for bringing the plague home, aka the kids, were completely unbothered by it. The more senior members, however, suffered yet soldiered bravely on… Yeah, right :P

It's written in stone somewhere in Yorkshire that having a cold requires either stew or soup. I only had a few recipes for stews or soups, so here provided an excellent excuse to create something new. I decided on soup and had a ready-to-hand group of captives to experiment on. Mwa-ha-ha!

### Carefully Deciding On The Ingredients

I thought the ingredients through very carefully, mainly by opening the fridge door and examining the contents. Cue a butternut squash lurking around in the bottom of my fridge. It had been lurking for two weeks, waiting to become… something, and if it lurked much longer, it would have the ignominy of becoming a fungus. Such a terrible end to the life of one little butternut squash! I could and would remedy the sad situation forthwith!

Decision made! Butternut Squash Soup it would be! Rescuing the butternut squash exposed some lurking carrots as well. How fortuitous! Butternut Squash and Carrot Soup – let's go!

A poorly (poorly = ill for those outside Yorkshire) person's soup needs to be warm, comforting and filling while imparting an illness-fighting boost to one's body. Foods like lemon, honey, and ginger work, or do they? I'm not sure, but surely old wives everywhere and a ton of tradition cannot be wrong. Regardless, they taste very nice together and are a distraction from one's nose-dripping misery.

#### Lemon And Honey Are Better For Drinking

So, one by one… Lemon. Lemon soup? Err… no! Ditch the lemon.
Honey? No, butternut squash carries carbs and is sweet enough without adding honey. I'll save my honey and use it for hot drinks along with the previously ditched lemons.

#### Ginger

Ginger? Ginger sounds nice. I'll add it, I decide. My fresh ginger turned out to be less fresh than I would like. It, too, had lurked in the fridge and had lurked into something unnameable. Bet everyone is thinking evil thoughts about the state of my fridge. In my defence, I was the first person the kids passed their cold along to. I hadn't felt like doing much for a while either! With my domestic abilities defended, I return to my story and the not-too-fresh-ginger, which I throw in the bin. With my mind, I chose to brave the afternoon heat of a Maltese summer to get some ginger that was a tad fresher.

On a side note here, when I first began living in Malta and got a cold, it felt incredibly strange. Coming as I do from a country that lacks great weather, colds come with Winter when it's cold and dark. If I have a cold, I expect freezing rain or falling snow and the wind blowing outside, not a blazing sun scorching the landscape.

#### Turmeric And Garlic

A fifteen-minute walk, and I arrive at the local supermarket. I chose a nice knobbly bit of ginger in the fruit and veg section and went to pay. There, ready to serve me, was a lovely man with a terrible hairstyle (or maybe I'm becoming old and unfashionable). We began a conversation about the ginger, _'Lovely Manbun'_ swore by its healing properties along with those of turmeric and garlic. I took his advice and bought some turmeric and garlic for my soup, along with the ginger.

#### Apple

Back at home and rather sweaty, I laid out my ingredients. I decided to add an apple for a bit of extra oomph! An apple a day keeps the doctor away, so they say. I am not sure it does, but apples help add flavour, and more taste is always good.

#### Fennel

Finally, I needed more aromatics. As my Mum was one of the poorly ones, I chose fennel rather than onion. My Mum also has digestive issues, and onion is one of her intolerances. for tummy health reasons.

#### Nutmeg And Cinnamon

I also added nutmeg and cinnamon just because. I always associate these two spices with warmth and comfort.

#### Liquids

Soup ingredients- all sorted? Check! Everything cooked? Check! Lastly, stock for liquidity and coconut cream for creaminess.

### Experimenting On The Sick

Experiment with the result by forcing anyone over the age of six with a handkerchief to eat it and watch for reactions. Success! I, and my soup, got a big thumbs up.

### Stretch The Recipe

One last point to make before I end this post: we all agreed that adding two more cups of stock to this would serve another person or two while still tasting just as delicious. However, I like this recipe's smoothness and thickness (calories? what are those?...) exactly as it is. So I, personally, have always kept the recipe the same since I first made it. But, if you have extra people to feed and want to save a few more pennies or even calories, add in the additional stock.

### And Finally...

As for any healing properties this soup may have, everyone eventually recovered from their colds.
