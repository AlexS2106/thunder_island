## About Almond flour chia bread

Almond Flour Chia Bread is soft, filling, delicious and an absolute winner. By including chia seeds and the whopping amount of fibre they add, you'll feel full on a small amount without detracting from the taste or adding to the net carbs.

This particular recipe makes a small loaf, excellent as a side dish for four or, even better, divide it into two for some soup dipping.

### The Good And The Not So Great

While considering a label for this bread, I went through numerous names trying to give an instant idea of where this recipe would be most beneficial. Basket bread, paleo aside-bread, chia seed soup bread. For obvious reasons, none of these names made it, but you can see where my ideas were.

Although I am advocating this bread for soups and baskets, don't discount covering this bread with some spread for breakfast or a quick snack when you feel hungry.

However, there are better alternatives around when it comes to holding a burger together or providing the endings to a loaded sandwich. This bread is a little too soft and crumbly to do the job.

## A Bit Tricky

One particular difficulty I have when making this bread is when I pour the bread batter into the tin. It's really tough to hold, aim and scrape in unison. I saw once where the author of [wholesomeyum](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/) had a nifty idea and kept the baking paper apart with pegs. I tried her trick, and it worked really well. I definitely recommend it. However, once, I forgot to remove the pegs - they were plastic... 45 minutes later, the bread was in the bin, and I spent most of the day scraping plastic from the oven. Grrr!
