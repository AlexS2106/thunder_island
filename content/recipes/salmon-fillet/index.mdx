## Salmon Fillet

Salmon Fillet was one of my earliest recipes when I started the paleo diet and my experimenting in the kitchen.

### Without Lemons, Please!

My first try at cooking salmon was a nice-looking recipe for salmon on the internet. It seemed basic enough with the salmon, some salt and lemons; my result was salted lemons with a moderately fishy aftertaste. Many different recipes later, things hadn't improved, and, not being a big fan of fish anyway, I was put off fish recipes for quite some time.

Eventually, spurred on by the knowledge that fish is healthy, I tried again. This time though, no lemons! I tried desperately to find a fish recipe without lemons. It should have been easy - it wasn't.

An unwritten law is forcing the general population to have lemons with fish! Not that I mind lemons with my fish, but having recipe after recipe fail so miserably, it would be nice to go without them. Add to this that my husband isn't a fan of lemon flavour anything; the lemons had to go.

### Lemon Free Salmon!

Eventually, I gave up searching and did it myself. I cooked the fish as plainly as possible - just like this recipe!
